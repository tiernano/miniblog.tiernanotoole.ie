So, It's been a few months and I have been busy with random stuff... I started on the [#100daysofhomelab](https://100daysofhomelab.com) challenge and so far have broken a lot of different things. I [tweet about it](https://twitter.com/tiernano) every day so far on Twitter. 

I am in the process of building the [CloudShed](https://cloudshed.net), by converting my old sheds into something more secure, weatherproof and connected to the servers of my home lab. 

I got [IPv6 working in the house with my own ASN](https://twitter.com/tiernano/status/1544045862304813058). 

I also got a second internet connection in! [2Gb/200Mb/s Fiber to the Home](https://twitter.com/tiernano/status/1537151411435233281). Very sweet and fast! 

So, I've been busy... 

I really should get back to writing stuff here...
