Back in March, I posted about [what I wanted to see in the next iPhone](https://miniblog.tiernanotoole.ie/posts/next-iphone-wishlist/). Well, on Wednesday 7th September, Apple announced the iPhone 14, 14 Max, 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max (along with new Apple Watches, but that's out of scope for this post). So, based on my wishlist, what did the Apple account release? Were they listening to me? Spoiler alert. Nope...

* USB C - Nope... not going to happen this time around.
* External reporting of video: Also looks like it's a No... It does seem that [Filmic](https://geni.us/Iadm6hu) has the [option of outputting a clean HDMI feed for video](https://filmicpro.helpscoutdocs.com/article/67-clean-hdmi-out-support-in-filmic-pro), but it also says it's not good enough (due to compression) for recording externally... 
* Better Camera: Yup. Looks like the main camera is now 48MP. 
* Recording from external Cameras: Nope. this would have depended on the USB C input...
* Center Stage for Front Camera... This is a partial one... So, I wanted to use the iPhone as a camera for the Apple TV. That does not seem to be an option (yet) but there is the option of using your [iPhone as a camera for your Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/01/iphone-as-mac-webcam-continuity-camera/). It uses the rear cameras of your phone and supports Center Stage too. I have tried this, and it works, but I don't have a proper mount for the phone. Hopefully, they get released soon enough. 

So, overall, I got 1 of my wishlist mostly fulfilled (i would have liked to see the 48MP shooters on the other 2 cameras as well...) and a partial... We see what happens next year...
