After moving to Edge from Firefox a few days back, i noticed all the stupid autoplay videos are back... After a bit of digging, there are a couple of steps to fix this:

First, go to [edge://flags](edge://flags). Search for **Show block option in autoplay settings** and mark it **Enabled**

Restart your browser and no to go [edge://settings/content/mediaAutoplay](edge://settings/content/mediaAutoplay) 

Select Block. This will block all Autoplaying Video on all sites. If you want to enable a particular site, you can add it to the allow list.

And that's it! No more stupid autoplaying videos!
