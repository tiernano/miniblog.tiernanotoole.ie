Day 107 of #100daysofhomelab and got some news and updates below:

* Still having issues with Bird 2 and Mikrotik... I seem to have gotten Mikrotik to announce its routes to Bird, but Bird not talking back... More shouting and cursing required...
* Cloudflare have announced [Unmetered Rate limiting](https://blog.cloudflare.com/unmetered-ratelimiting/) on their service. Originally, you needed to pay $5 per million requests. Now, you can have 1 rule for free plans, 2 for Pro and 5 for Business. 
* They also have a [deal with YubiKey](https://blog.cloudflare.com/making-phishing-defense-seamless-cloudflare-yubico/) where you can get YubiKeys though Cloudflare for as little at $10 per key! 
* Still working on fixing all the issues with my [main blog](https://www.tiernanotoole.ie) before i do a full move to Hugo. Its a bit of a pain cleaning up image links...
