Day 101 of #100daysofhomelab is mostly more work on my Cloudflare Workers stuff...

* Trying to adapt the [edge cache html](https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/blob/main/examples/edge-cache-html/edge-cache-html.js) worker from Cloudflare to work with my [Cloudinary Re Writer](https://github.com/tiernano/cloudinary-rewrtier).
* looking into building an app for automatically uploading images to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/invites/lpov9zyyucivvxsnalc5/odc5hvptjxifri3jusn9?t=default) based on what is in a markdown file, and then rewrite the URL to use said URL...
* Actual home lab stuff is checking for updates. I am finished my holidays now, so i should be back mostly in the homelab, so more actual homelab stuff coming in the next few days.
