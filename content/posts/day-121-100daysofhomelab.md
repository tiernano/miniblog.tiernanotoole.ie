Day 121 of #100daysofhomelab:

* Playing with [Cloudflare Zero Trust SSH](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/use_cases/ssh/). Managed to get the [web based SSH client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/#rendering-in-the-browser) working, along with the [short lived certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/users/short-lived-certificates/) bit.
* Seem to be having issues with my [Virgin Media Business](https://www.virginmedia.ie/business/) Cable Modem... seems to fall over every now and again, causing Wireguard to loose the connection... Failed over to my [Blacknight Business FTTH link](https://www.blacknight.com/broadband/business/) which is more stable...
* more tweaks to the [twitter card](https://miniblog.tiernanotoole.ie/posts/generating-twitter-card-images-in-hugo/) stuff on the site too.
* this weekend i need to finish my IPv4/IPv6 renumbering and start announcing my new space on [AS204994](https://as204994.net). I will have some posts around that soon enough.
