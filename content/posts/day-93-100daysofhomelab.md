Today i have been working on the Active Directory setup for the house. AD01 is running. Getting DNS sorted now and will get AD02 joined soon enough. Next tasks:

* [Azure AD Sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-whatis)
* Join any Windows and Linux (possibly Macs?) to AD for auth
* [WSUS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-server-update-services/get-started/windows-server-update-services-wsus) support for Windows Boxes
* Single Sign On for [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/zero-trust/access/).
