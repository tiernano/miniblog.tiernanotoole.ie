Trying out a new editor called [Typora](https://typora.io/). It is meant to be one of these minimal editors, and so far, it is. But it's also a little confusing... Mind you, I do not read docs, so that's probably why I'm confused... 

On other notes, still working on the [#100daysofhomelab](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfHomeLab) on Twitter. Still running my own [ASN](https://as204994.net/), swapped my firewall to a [Sophos XG home edition](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/free-tools/sophos-xg-firewall-home-edition), and I've been playing with some other things too. For more random updates, check out my Twitter feed [@tiernano](https://twitter.com/tiernano). Hopefully, I will start posting stuff here more, eventually...
