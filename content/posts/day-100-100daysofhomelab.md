I finally made it! day 100 of #100daysofhomelab and a post about what I have done in that 100 Days!

Some Tweet Stats. I got the info from [Vicinitas](https://www.vicinitas.io/free-tools/download-user-tweets) and exported my last 3200 tweets to Excel. Filter based on the tweet including the #100daysofhomelab hashtag and here are some numbers:

* first, It looks like i have posted 210 Tweets to the #100daysofhomelab hashtag (excluding this one...).
* first post was on [12 June](https://twitter.com/tiernano/status/1536103404996640768) about getting the FTTH ground works installed.
* My most liked tweet was about [IPv6 fixing my issue with Proxmox Backups in Hetzner](https://twitter.com/tiernano/status/1545708744914485248).

Now, things i have learned and worked on in those 100 days:

* [Proxmox installed on first box in the house](https://twitter.com/tiernano/status/1536837253837766659). Now have it running on 3 in total in a cluster!

So, its been a busy few months! I am going to continue using the [miniblog](https://miniblog.tiernanotoole.ie) as a homelab blog, but will have some stuff up on [the main blog](https://tiernanotoole.ie) or the [Cloudshed blog](https://cloudshed.net). Not sure if i should still be using #100daysofhomelab. I have seen some tweets for day 101 and 102... So, maybe it will continue! We will see!
