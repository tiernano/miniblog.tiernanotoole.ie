Day 90 of [#100daysofhomelab](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfHomeLab) (nearly finished!) and I have done a couple of bits and pieces:

* moved back to [OpnSense](https://opnsense.org/) on my network. It's getting easier to move between routers... 
* Set up [SmokePing](https://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/) (again) to try to track down an issue with my network... so far, looks like the underlay (cable modem) is stable... some minor drops, but more monitoring is required...
