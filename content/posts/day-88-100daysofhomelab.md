This is an extension to my main #100daysofhomelab tweet for day 88. 

* tweaks to Sophos XG to include SD-WAN Stuff. I have an LTE modem (hooked up via Ethernet, a [NetGear LB2120](https://geni.us/EJli)) 

* I seem to have lost the connection between my IoT network and the rest of the network... I need to figure out the full details of how Sophos XG does routing... More doc reading is required...
* Still trying to get [OpenStick](https://github.com/OpenStick/OpenStick/) working on my new 4G dongles...
