Day 96 of #100daysofhomelab and its mostly Azure AD Auth stuff.

* I moved all Proxmox Auth over to Azure AD, [as of my last update](https://miniblog.tiernanotoole.ie/posts/proxmox-azure-ad-auth/). 
* Setup [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/zero-trust/access/) to use Azure AD
* Both my [QNAP](https://geni.us/bYJAz) and [Synology](https://geni.us/UYjb2t) boxes now use AD for auth.
