So, my [Blackmagic 6k Pocket Cinema Camera](https://miniblog.tiernanotoole.ie/posts/new-camera-on-the-way/) arrived a couple of weeks back, and I have been doing some testing with it, and I wanted to share something interesting... The Video sizes are large! Very LARGE. Shooting 6k Blackmagic 12:1 RAW, a 1-minute 4-second video at 30FPS is 5.2GB in size. and the 2-minute 22-second clip is 11.65GB. The first video I shot with it and posted to Youtube about my [Quad 2.5Gb/s router](https://youtu.be/1uM-RCZSemE) took 27 gigs of RAW video for around 5 min of Youtube video (the final exported 4k Video was under 400MB!) With all this said, my [MacBook Pro 16"](https://geni.us/VQB7) with M1 Max and 64GB RAM had no issues processing or working with it, so at least there is that...
