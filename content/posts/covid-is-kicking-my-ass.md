Ok, I say it's kicking my ass, but it is defiantly not as bad as some people got it. Its the bad flu. I have had 3 full dosses of the vaccine, so I am as dossed up as I can be. But I still feel like I have been hit by a trail being driven by Mike Tyson. Hot honey, lemon and whiskey drink will hopefully help me sleep... fingers are crossed.
