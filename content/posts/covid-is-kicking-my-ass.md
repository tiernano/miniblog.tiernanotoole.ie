Ok, i say its kicking my ass, but it is defiantly not as bad as some people got it. Its a bad flu. I have had 3 full dosses of the vaccine, so I am as dossed up as i can be. But i still feel like i have been hit by a trail being driven by Mike Tyson. A hot honey, lemon and whiskey drink will hopefully help me sleep... fingers crossed.
