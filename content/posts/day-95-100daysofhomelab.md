Day 95 of #100daysofhomelab and I have been playing with [Proxmox Azure AD Auth](https://miniblog.tiernanotoole.ie/posts/proxmox-azure-ad-auth/). I have been mostly OOHL (Out Of Home Lab) for the day, and ended up driving 358KM  and for about 4h34m. Fuel consumption was not too bad, mind you... More driving next week, more messing with homelab when i get home.
