So, we are coming up to the end of [#100daysofhomelab](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfHomeLab), and I have been thinking of some future work for the home lab and what I would like to get done over the next 100 days (well, 109, since I'm on day 91). Below is a list of things going into my homelab backlog, in no particular order...

* Build out AD Servers in house, and hook up to Office365 for single sign-on
* Hook Azure AD to Cloudflare for Single Sing On for Cloudflare Access
* Expose more internal services over Cloudflare Access
* InTune manage any laptops I have
* Setup new Wifi and VPN with RADIUS auth using AD
* Move servers into the Cloudshed. 
* Get GodBoxV3 running ProxMox.
* Migrate GodBoxV1 to ProxMox. 
* Build a new storage box. (16x8Tb Spinning Rust + 8x960Gb SSDs + 4X10Gb NICs)
* QNAP box to be used for Video Editing stuff (it has 5x8Tb spinny drives + 4x960Gb SSDs)
* Synology box to be used for Backups and other bulk stuff (8x8Tb spinny drives)
* new storage box to be used for Media and other stuff. 

This should be enough to start with for a while.
