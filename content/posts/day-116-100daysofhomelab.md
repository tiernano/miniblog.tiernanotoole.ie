Day 116 of #100daysofhomelab, and this is the first real day in the since day 109... Been out of commission due to a cold and back issues... tonight's post is brought to you by Jameson Whiskey, some honey and hot water...

 Some updates:

* [Zerotier 2.0 is back in Development](https://twitter.com/adamierymenko/status/1578437120318144512) which is sounding VERY COOL! Hopefully i will get to play with it soon!
* Managed to get my Bird 2.0 instance in VMHaus talking to my Mikrotik in house and Bird 1.6. More details due soon.
* Been reading some stuff about using [Notion as a Headless CMS for blogging](https://datanarratives.com/blog/notion-headless-cms/). Also found [this post](https://pipedream.com/blog/publish-notion-pages-as-blog-posts/) on how to do it with [PipeDream](https://pipedream.io), one of my favorite online tool!

Hopefully tomorrow i will be back in the land of the living, and will get some more updates done. Next task is to move the rest of my BGP boxes to Bird 2.0... Stay tuned!
