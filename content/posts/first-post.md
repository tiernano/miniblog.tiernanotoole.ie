I have been trying to write quick notes about what's going on in a journal, but 1: I can't read my handwriting, and 2: It becomes painful to write too much... I do plan on still writing stuff in a journal since I kind of want my handwriting to get better... it's been a LOT of years since I have had to write anything of any length on paper, but this makes things a little easier for writing quick stuff.

So, as my first post, some quick notes:

* The mammy has covid... or at least it looks like she does. The antigen test came back positive... Mine came back negative but will do another one tomorrow. My throat is sore, and I have been pretty tired for the last few days... More tests tomorrow.
* after waiting nearly 6 months, my 2021 Mac Book Pro 16" with M1 Max and 64GB RAM plus 1TB SSD arrived yesterday. It was a BTO and was ordered from the shop back in October... It's a VERY nice machine. Benchmarks are due on the main site eventually.
* This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and written in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). It uses [GitHub](https://www.github.com) for storage and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) for building and hosting. 

That's enough for a first post. More later...
