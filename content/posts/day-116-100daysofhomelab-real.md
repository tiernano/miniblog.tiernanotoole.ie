the real Day 116 (not like that fake 116 from yesterday...) of #100daysofhomelab and there are a few big changes going on.

* Big Job! Renumbering my homelab IPs. I have change providers for the leasing of my V4 and V6 space. In doing so, I have had to renumber with a different /24. Also, as part of this move, I get my hands on a /44 IPv6 Range. This gives me 16 full /48s that can be announced separately... How that is going to work, I'm not sure yet. This is going to take a few days!
* Above will also be done while upgrading to Bird 2.0, which is still ongoing.
