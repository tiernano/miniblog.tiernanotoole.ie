Day 99 of #100daysofhomelab... and i'm still trying to get Azure AD Sync working...

* I have an on-prem AD which is brand new, and an Azure AD which has been in production since 2012... I have an on prem user and a main Azure AD user, but getting them to sync is not working... Ugh... I keep getting an `AttributeValueMustBeUnique` Error... I also seem to be getting `permission-issue` errors... I AM THE ADMINISTRATOR! WTF?!
* [Microsoft now have Systemd support in WSL](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/systemd-support-is-now-available-in-wsl/).
* Plex Pro week, 2022 started a few days ago with [a video from Linus Tech Tips](https://www.plex.tv/blog/pro-week-day-1-linus/). Some other interesting articles on [their blog here](https://www.plex.tv/blog/).
* I am still battling with my Cloudflare Workers Rewrite thing, but I am thinking of moving from [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) back to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I can then add the photo work as part of the Hugo build...
* Finally, I added comments using [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/) to this site. You need a [Github](https://github.com) account to comment, but try it out! 

Tomorrow is day 100 of #100daysofhomelab, and I am planning a retrospective of what I have done over the last 100 days!
