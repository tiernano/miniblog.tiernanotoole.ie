Day 92, and I am reading about IPSec, Load balancing over IPSec, Load balancing over Wireguard, and at this stage, my head hurts... So far, I am not 100% sure its possible... More digging and messing required.

On a more different note, i have been using VSCode for editing the blog, and found the a cool addon called [Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image).
