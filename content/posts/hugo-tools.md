Some quick links to some tools I am using for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

* [Hugoify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=akmittal.hugofy) for VS code: Hugofy is a plugin for Visual Studio Code to make life easier to use Hugo static site generator
* [Hugo Language and Syntax Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=budparr.language-hugo-vscode): Syntax highlighting and snippets for Hugo's websites.
* Not technically a tool, but the [Hugo Docs pages](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) are very useful.
