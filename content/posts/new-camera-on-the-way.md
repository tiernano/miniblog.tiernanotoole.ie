I did something a little silly... I just ordered a new Camera...  a [Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K](https://geni.us/pckzHl). I also purchased a [128GB CFAST 2 card](https://geni.us/Ld8Udg) plus a [Sandisk Pro CFAST 2.0 Reader](https://geni.us/S4b6eg). Should be here in the next week or so... 6K video will be interesting. Plus, it uses the same EF Mount lenses I currently use for my [Canon 5DS DSLR](https://geni.us/Y0hY1W4). More soon on it, plus some sample videos up on the [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnO1hWqq1s7eJVYQNQE4TrQ).
