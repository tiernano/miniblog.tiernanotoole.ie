Day 108 of #100daysofhomelab and, its a mix of news and updates.

* Been digging around [dn42.eu](https://dn42.eu) and found their [bird 2](https://dn42.eu/howto/Bird2) config page. Hopefully that helps me get it working... 
* Cloudflare have a new [outage center](https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center) showing outage info from world wide. And there is a [blog post explaining it](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-cloudflare-radar-outage-center/)
* They also upgraded [Radar to 2.0](https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar2/).
* And since Alexa (not the echo one, but old Alexa) is dead, [Radar now takes on that roll](https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-domain-rankings/).
